# Block Domain Names on your Pihole

A simple script to block/unblock domain names in local network. Just feed the list of piholes, (if you have more than one), add domain names to domains list, hide your API-token and call it.

You can also populate other pihole lists. Just change 'black' for 'white' or else  while calling function args.
